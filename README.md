This GitHub project is dedicated to promoting cybersecurity awareness among friends and family. Additionally, it serves as a platform to mentor my son and guide him towards a career in cybersecurity, fostering the next generation of security professionals through guidance and knowledge sharing.

## Objective

I have a few odd years in the IT industry. My journey in client services has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, I am enjoying my job as a SOC analyst responding to alerts and incidences in the installation stage to the kill chain. With the experience gained in a few years I look forward to my transition to Threat Intelligence.
