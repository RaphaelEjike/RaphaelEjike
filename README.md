This GitHub project is dedicated to promoting cybersecurity awareness among friends and family. Additionally, it serves as a platform to mentor my son and guide him towards a career in cybersecurity, fostering the next generation of security professionals through guidance and knowledge sharing.

## Objective

Over the years, I have documented my journey in client services and cybersecurity through my old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mysystemcenter818">YouTube channel</a> and  <a href="https://raphaelejike.blogspot.com">Blogspot</a>. Gradually, I will transfer most of this relevant knowledge to my GitHub. In my opinion, GitHub is an excellent platform for sharing knowledge with colleagues, friends, and family.
